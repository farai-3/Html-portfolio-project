<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an aspiring full-stack developer with a strong passion for programming and continuous learning. I enjoy
  building fully functional applications and understanding how to maintain, improve, and scale them over time.
  I am committed to growing my skills across both front-end and back-end technologies, and I consistently
  challenge myself to learn new tools, frameworks, and best practices as I work toward becoming a well
  rounded developer.
